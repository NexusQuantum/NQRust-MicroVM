echo "1. When a VM is created, guest_agent::install_to_rootfs() is called"
echo "2. The VM rootfs is mounted and guest-agent binary is copied to /usr/local/bin/"
echo "3. OpenRC service is created and enabled for auto-start on boot"
echo "4. IP reporting script is created to auto-register with manager"
echo "5. VM starts with guest agent running"
echo "6. Guest agent reports its IP to manager via /v1/vms/{id}/guest-ip endpoint"
echo "7. Manager queries guest agent for real CPU/memory metrics"
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "- Create a new VM to test automatic installation"
echo "- Check VM metrics in frontend to see real guest CPU/memory usage"
